## A_B Test
### Discription
**These project is a final project for statistics part in data science nanodegree .It's about making test called A_B test it's used to compare between two hypothesis alternative hypotheseis and null hypothesis**
### Target 
**project here is about lanching a new page in website and we want to measure if the new page is have an affect in converton rate or not**
### Steps
**1-In these project the null hypothesis is the the new page has no effect in converstion rate and the alternative hypothesis is the new page is effected in convertion rate and we compare between two hypothesis by P_value**\
**2-Then I make a logistic regression model to get a realble relation between convertion rate and type of page and show the P-value also we entered countries later in regression model to know if the convertion rate is effected depending on country**
### Results
**In the end we discover that the new page has no effect at all in convertion rate also after adding countries to our model so we can not reject the null hypotheis or P_value not statistical significance for hypothes 1**
