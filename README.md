## A_B Test
### Discription
**This project is a final project for the statistics part of the data science nano degree. It's about making test called A_B test it's used to compare between two hypothesis alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis**
### Target 
**project here is about launching a new page in the website and we want to measure if the new page has an effect on conversion rate or not**
### Steps
**1-In these project the null hypothesis is the new page has no effect on conversion rate and the alternative hypothesis is the new page is affected in conversion rate and we compare between two hypotheses by P_value**\
**2-Then I make a logistic regression model get a reliable relation between conversion rate and type of page and show the P-value also we entered countries later in a regression model to know if the conversion rate is affected depending on the country**
### Results
**In the end, we discover that the new page has no effect at all in conversion rate also after adding countries to our model so we can not reject the null hypothesis or P_value, not statistical significance for hypothesis 1**
